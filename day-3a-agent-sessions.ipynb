Here are some of the key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Drug Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecules:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of screening vast libraries of existing compounds, AI (specifically generative models like GANs or variational autoencoders) can *design entirely new molecules* with desired properties. This allows for exploration of chemical space that was previously inaccessible.\n    *   **Example:** AI can be trained on existing drugs and their targets to generate molecules predicted to bind strongly to a new target protein.\n*   **Predicting Compound Properties:** AI models are becoming much better at predicting a molecule's efficacy, toxicity, solubility, and how it will be metabolized (pharmacokinetics) *before* it's synthesized. This drastically reduces the number of compounds that need to be physically tested, saving time and resources.\n*   **De Novo Design:** AI is enabling the design of drugs \"from scratch\" for specific targets, moving beyond simply modifying existing structures.\n\n**2. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Omics Data Integration:** AI excels at analyzing massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This helps researchers identify novel disease-causing genes, proteins, or pathways that can serve as drug targets.\n*   **Network Biology:** AI can map complex biological networks and identify key nodes (potential targets) that, if modulated, could effectively treat a disease.\n*   **Real-world Evidence (RWE) Analysis:** AI can sift through RWE (from electronic health records, insurance claims, etc.) to identify patient populations that might respond well to certain targets or therapies, or to uncover new disease mechanisms.\n\n**3. Enhancing Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict disease progression or response to treatment, which are crucial for patient stratification and trial success.\n*   **Predictive Modeling for Trial Outcomes:** AI can analyze early trial data to predict the likelihood of success, helping companies make go/no-go decisions earlier.\n*   **Optimizing Trial Design:** AI can help in designing more efficient clinical trials by identifying optimal patient cohorts and study parameters.\n*   **Virtual Patients and Digital Twins:** While still in early stages, the concept of creating \"digital twins\" of patients or disease models using AI could revolutionize pre-clinical testing and personalize treatment strategies.\n\n**4. New Modalities and Platforms:**\n\n*   **RNA Therapeutics:** AI is being used to design more stable and effective RNA-based therapies (like mRNA vaccines and gene therapies).\n*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** AI can design novel peptide sequences with therapeutic potential.\n*   **CRISPR and Gene Editing:** AI is assisting in designing guide RNAs for CRISPR systems and predicting off-target effects.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A prominent example, they use AI for target discovery, molecule generation, and have advanced AI-discovered drugs into clinical trials.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map human cellular structures and identify potential drug candidates.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven drug design for small molecules, aiming to rapidly identify and optimize lead compounds.\n*   **DeepMind (Alphabet):** Their AlphaFold 2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction, which is fundamental for understanding drug-target interactions.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Drug Discovery:**\n\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** AI is dramatically shortening the timeline for identifying potential drug candidates.\n*   **Novelty:** AI is enabling the discovery of completely new types of molecules and targeting strategies.\n*   **Precision:** Treatments are becoming more personalized and targeted due to AI's ability to analyze complex biological data.\n*   **Reduced Cost:** By streamlining the process and reducing failures, AI has the potential to lower the exorbitant costs of drug development.\n\nThe field is moving incredibly fast, so specific announcements are made almost daily. The trend is clear: AI is no longer just a tool for analysis but a central engine driving innovation in drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned, which was **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this entails and why it's so significant:\n\n**The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nBefore AI, finding a new target for a drug was often a laborious and serendipitous process. Researchers would:\n*   Study a disease, observing its symptoms and known molecular players.\n*   Hypothesize that interfering with a particular protein or pathway might alleviate the disease.\n*   Conduct extensive experiments to confirm this hypothesis.\n*   This could take years and often yielded targets that were difficult to drug or had unforeseen side effects.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n\nAI's power lies in its ability to process and find patterns within massive, complex datasets that are far beyond human cognitive capacity. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can scan an individual's or a population's DNA (genome) to identify genetic variations associated with diseases. For example, it can find mutations in genes that are more prevalent in people with a certain cancer.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI analyzes RNA levels (transcriptome) to understand which genes are actively being expressed (turned on) in diseased cells versus healthy cells. This can reveal key regulatory processes gone awry.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI examines the proteins (proteome) present in cells or tissues. Since proteins are the workhorses of the cell and many drugs target proteins, identifying abnormal proteins or altered protein levels in disease is crucial.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) in biological samples, revealing metabolic pathways that are dysregulated in disease.\n    *   **Integration:** The real power comes when AI integrates these diverse \"omics\" datasets. It can find correlations that wouldn't be apparent from analyzing just one type of data, revealing complex interactions leading to disease.\n\n2.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n    *   Biological systems are not linear; they are intricate networks of interacting genes, proteins, and signaling pathways.\n    *   AI algorithms can build sophisticated models of these networks. By analyzing how disruptions propagate through the network, AI can pinpoint critical nodes (like a specific protein or enzyme) that, if targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect and potentially restore system balance.\n    *   Think of it like a complex electrical circuit. AI can identify the single faulty component that, when fixed, resolves multiple problems in the system.\n\n3.  **Leveraging Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n    *   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** AI can analyze anonymized EHR data to identify patient cohorts with specific disease profiles, track disease progression, and even observe unexpected associations between certain biological markers and outcomes.\n    *   **Claims Data:** AI can identify patterns in insurance claims that might indicate disease onset or progression, or reveal populations that respond differently to existing treatments, hinting at new therapeutic targets.\n    *   **Wearable and Sensor Data:** As more individuals use wearables, AI can analyze this continuous stream of physiological data to detect early signs of disease or subtle changes in health status that might point to underlying molecular issues.\n\n4.  **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:**\n    *   AI can \"read\" and digest millions of scientific papers, patents, and databases.\n    *   It can build \"knowledge graphs\" that map relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and biological processes. This helps researchers discover connections that might have been overlooked in siloed research.\n\n**Significance of AI in Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Increased Speed:** AI can analyze data and generate hypotheses in days or weeks that would have taken years with traditional methods.\n*   **Broader Scope:** AI can identify targets for diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable\" or where the underlying biology was poorly understood.\n*   **Higher Probability of Success:** By identifying targets that are strongly linked to disease mechanisms and are potentially druggable, AI can increase the likelihood that drugs developed against them will be effective.\n*   **Personalized Targets:** AI can help identify targets that are specific to certain patient subgroups (e.g., based on their genetic makeup), paving the way for more personalized medicine.\n\nIn essence, AI acts as a powerful magnifying glass and pattern-recognition engine for the vast and complex landscape of biological data, enabling scientists to discover the most promising \"levers\" to pull to treat diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are heavily involved in leveraging AI for drug target identification and validation.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
